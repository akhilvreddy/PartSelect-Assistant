If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before. Then it is as simple as reassembling the rest of your dishwasher, ensuring each connection point is fastened tightly."
